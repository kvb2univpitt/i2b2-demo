## Docker User-defined Bridge Network

The container runs on a user-defined bridge network ***i2b2-demo-net***.  The user-defined bridge network provides better isolation and allows containers on the same network to communicate with each other using their container names instead of their IP addresses.

### Ensure User-defined Bridge Network Exists

To verify that the network ***i2b2-demo-net*** exists, execute the following command to list all of the Docker's networks:

```
docker network ls
```

The output should be similar to this:

```
NETWORK ID     NAME                 DRIVER    SCOPE
9ea1de540506   bridge               bridge    local
bf7e75025889   host                 host      local
88a9b525113e   i2b2-demo-net   bridge    local
```

If ***i2b2-demo-net*** network is **not** listed, execute the following command to create it:

```
docker network create i2b2-demo-net
```

## Run the Prebuilt Image

A prebuilt Docker image is provided on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kvb2univpitt/i2b2-idp-demo).

### Prerequisites

- [Docker 19 or above](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Open up a terminal and execute the following command to download and run the prebuilt image in a container named ***i2b2-idp-demo***.

###### Linux / macOS:

```
docker run -d --name=i2b2-idp-demo \
--network i2b2-demo-net \
-p 8080:8080 \
-p 8443:8443 \
-e SIMPLESAMLPHP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=demouser \
kvb2univpitt/i2b2-idp-demo:v1.7.13.2022.06
```

###### Windows:

```
docker run -d --name=i2b2-idp-demo ^
