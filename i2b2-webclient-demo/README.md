# i2b2-webclient-demo

A Docker image of i2b2 web client ([Release 1.8.0](https://github.com/i2b2/i2b2-webclient/releases/tag/v1.8.0.0002)) for demonstration purposes.

## Docker User-defined Bridge Network

The container runs on a user-defined bridge network ***i2b2-demo-net***.  The user-defined bridge network provides better isolation and allows containers on the same network to communicate with each other using their container names instead of their IP addresses.

### Ensure User-defined Bridge Network Exists

To verify that the network ***i2b2-demo-net*** exists, execute the following command to list all of the Docker's networks:

```
docker network ls
```

The output should be similar to this:

```
NETWORK ID     NAME            DRIVER    SCOPE
d86843421945   bridge          bridge    local
58593240ad9d   host            host      local
9a82abc00473   i2b2-demo-net   bridge    local
```

If ***i2b2-demo-net*** network is **not** listed, execute the following command to create it:

```
docker network create i2b2-demo-net
```

## Run the Prebuilt Image

A prebuilt Docker image is provided on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kvb2univpitt/i2b2-webclient-demo).

### Prerequisites
